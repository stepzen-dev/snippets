# Some systems like Firebase and Mavenlink return a set of records, not as an array, but as a JSON object.
# Each record is keyed off something unique (an internal "id" for example).
# The data for that record is the value of that key.
# However, this does not work for GraphQL, because each record cannot become its own type.
# We show you how to convert this JSON object into an array, so that subsequent processing can be done.
# In the first query, we transform the object at the root but return JSON.
# In the second query, we further transform the object to set the right fields.
