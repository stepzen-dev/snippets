"""
Since we used `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` as a value for our `Content-Type` header, StepZen will
encode the postbody as form-encoded and the httpbin.org/post will return 
it in form. You'll see that `args` and `data` will be empty, and `json` will be null, when you run the following query.
query MyQuery {
  restquery(name: "Joe Smith", city: "New York") {
    args
    data
    files
    form
    json
  }
}

type Query {
    restquery(name:String, city: String): Root
    # Set a JSON query return type to avoid any type conflicts that you might have during testing.
    # You cannot subselect fields this way.
    # restquery(name:String, city: String): JSON

"""
When the 'Accept' header is `application/json`, StepZen will automatically populate the body.  
Note: if method POST is used, The default for `Content-Type` is `application/json`.

Using the sample GraphQL query, data will show the contents of the postbody and json as transformed to JSON.
[Try it without the `name` or `city` and see it populate the values for `name` and `city` in a JSON object.]

Sample GraphQL Query:

query MyQuery {
  restjsonbodyquery(name: "Joe Smith", city: "New York") {
    args
    data
    form
    json
  }
}
