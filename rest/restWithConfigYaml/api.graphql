# This example shows how query arguments are automatically substituted into the REST call.
# It includes how you can also get REST query parameters from config.yaml file.
# In this example, `apikey` is obtained from `config.yaml`.

# We use `httpbingo.org` because it is a helpful REST API built with documentation and samples in mind.
# The httpbin service returns a payload depending on the call.
# Use the curl call directly.
