  firstCustomer extracts a single customer from a paginated field.
  A sequence is used to convert a list `[Customer]` into a singleton `Customer`.
  This will select an arbitrary value from the list, but in this case it is known
  the list will have a single element as the selection of the paginated field
  has first set to a constant `1`.

  _firstCustomer uses a selection in `@materializer` to pull up
  the nodes of `CustomerEdge` into a simple list of `[Customer]`.
  `first` is set to the constant `1` so that only a single customer
  is returned (or none) and thus `firstCustomer` becomes determinstic.
