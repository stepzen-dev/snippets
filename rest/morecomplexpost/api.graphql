# using GetJSON which will return a JSON associated

# GetJSON will return a null if the city or name was not specified
# GetJSON is preferred for application/JSON 
# The syntax is `{{.GetJSON "name-of-the-argument"}}`
# 
# You can also use Get which will return a string version
# of the input--where possible--and is well suited for use in 
# XML, forms, etc.
