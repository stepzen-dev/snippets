# Here we create a `postbody` from the query argument 
# using `GetJSON` which will return a JSON item associated
# with one of the inputs.
# `GetJSON` will return a null value if the city or name was not specified.
# `GetJSON` is preferred for an 'Accept' header with an `application/JSON` value.
# The syntax is `{{.GetJSON "name-of-the-argument"}}`
# 
# You can also use `Get` which will return a string version
# of the input--where possible--and is well suited for use in 
# XML, forms, etc.   However, `Get` gets more complicated
# in terms of careful escaping. Wherever possible, use `GetJSON`.
