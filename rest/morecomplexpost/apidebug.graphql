Explore an rest API using JSON as the return value as in `restJSONquery` below, then see what the
REST API returned in context of how the StepZen services process the request.

Try issuing the following with name and/or city removed to see the effects.
```
curl https://ACCOUNTNAME.stepzen.net/api/miscellaneous/__graphql \
    --header "Authorization: Apikey $(stepzen whoami --apikey)" \
    --header "Content-Type: application/json" \
    --data '{"query": "{restJSONquery(name: \"Joe Smith\" city:\"New York\")}"}'
```

StepZen services return diagnostics in the GraphQL response
as extensions when you add a StepZen-Debug-Level header "1" and use your admin key.
```
curl https://ACCOUNTNAME.stepzen.net/api/miscellaneous/__graphql \
    --header "Authorization: Apikey $(stepzen whoami --adminkey)" \
    --header "Content-Type: application/json" \
    --header "StepZen-Debug-Level: 1" \
    --data '{"query": "{restJSONquery(name: \"Joe Smith\" city:\"New York\")}"}'
```
