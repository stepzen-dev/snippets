# This example shows how @dbquery is configured for custom SQL queries with Customer data.

"""
Represents a customer in the system, stored in the 'customer' table of a PostgreSQL database.
Each customer has an ID, name, and email. The 'Customer' type maps directly to the
corresponding table fields.
"""
type Customer {
    id: ID!
    name: String
    email: String
}

"""
Defines the root-level queries for fetching customer data.
These queries use the `@dbquery` directive to execute custom SQL queries.
The SQL queries include parameter markers, which correspond to the GraphQL field arguments.

The 'customer' table in PostgreSQL has the following structure:

  CREATE TABLE customer (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,          -- Unique identifier with sequence
    name CHARACTER(50) NOT NULL,    -- Customer's name, max 50 characters
    email CHARACTER(50) NOT NULL,   -- Customer's email, max 50 characters, must be unique
    CONSTRAINT customer_email_key UNIQUE (email)  -- Unique constraint on email
  );
These queries demonstrate basic SQL interactions with this table.
"""
type Query {
    """
    Fetches a list of all customers from the database.

    The custom SQL query retrieves the `id`, `name`, and `email` fields from the 'customer' table.

    **@dbquery Directive Usage**:
    - `query`: This is the SQL query that will be executed. Here, it fetches all records from the 'customer' table.
    - `type`: Specifies the type of database being queried. In this case, itâ€™s a PostgreSQL database.
    - `configuration`: References the database configuration (connection details) in StepZen.

    This query does not take any arguments, and hence there are no parameter markers in the SQL query.
    The SQL query is static, always returning all customers from the database.
    """
    customers: [Customer]
        @dbquery(
            query: "SELECT id, name, email FROM customer"
            type: "postgresql"
            configuration: "postgresql_config"
        )

    """
    Fetches a single customer by their ID from the database.

    **Field Argument to Parameter Marker Mapping**:
    - The `id` argument provided in the GraphQL query maps to the `$1` marker in the SQL query.
    - SQL queries typically use numbered markers (e.g., `$1`, `$2`, etc.) for parameterized inputs. The number refers to the position of the argument in the query.
    - When a query is executed, the value passed to the `id` argument in GraphQL (via variables) will replace the `$1` marker in the SQL query.

    **@dbquery Directive Usage**:
    - `query`: This is the SQL query that will be executed. Here, the customer data is fetched based on the provided `id` value.
      - The `$1` marker is a placeholder for the value of the `id` argument, which is passed as a variable when executing the query.
    - `type`: Specifies the type of database being queried (PostgreSQL).
    - `configuration`: References the database configuration (connection details) in StepZen.

    This query requires an `id` argument as input, which is passed as a variable from the GraphQL query. The variable's value is used to fetch the corresponding customer from the database.
