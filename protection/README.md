# protection

For more information on protecting your API, [see our documentation](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/api-connect/ace/saas?topic=endpoints-using-jwt-based-access-control).

- [jwt-claims](jwt-claims) shows how JWT claims can be used for field arguments.
- [jwt-claims-dbquery](jwt-claims-dbquery) shows using JWT claims to control what can be accessed from a database.
- [makeAllPublic](makeAllPublic) shows how you can easily make all `Query` fields public, thus resulting in a public endpoint.
- [makeSomePublic](makeSomePublic) shows how you can make fields public, and some private (which can still be accessed using your `admin` or `service` keys).
- [simpleABACSample](simpleABACSample) shows how to control access to fields using JWT claims.
