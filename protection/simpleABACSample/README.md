## Simple Attribute-Based Access Control
In this snippet we do not supply any schema; you will create that by importing an existing GraphQL API, the SpaceX API.

We provide a config.yaml for the API you import that uses StepZen's field policies to control access to the fields using JWT claims.

## Access Control Details
In the provided config.yaml, we have specified the keys for an HS256-signed JWT. We're using this for simplicity. In a production environment you would either use RS256 or preferably the jwksendpoint for an OpenID based identity provider.


We've also specified the following policies:
1. Only users with a valid JWT with an "allow_mutations" claim of 'true' can request mutations.
2. Only users with a valid JWT and a "roles" claim that has an entry of "history-viewer" can request history-related entry point fields.
3. Only users with a valid JWT and a "roles" claim that contains "launch-viewer" can request launch-related entry point fields.
4. Only users with a valid JWT and a "CUSTOM_ClAIM" with a value of greater than 40 for the "level" attribute can request the "roadster" entry point field.
5. The default policy for fields not covered by the above policies is to allow access, no JWT required.

## Steps to follow
1. Create a working directory for your API.
2. In the working directory, run the stepzen import command to import the SpaceX API. Accept the default or provide an endpoint for the API when prompted.
```
âž” stepzen import graphql "https://api.spacex.land/graphql/"
? What would you like your endpoint to be called? dev/spacex
Starting... done
Successfully imported schema graphql from StepZen

âž”
```
3. Copy the config.yaml in this directory into your working directory.
4. Deploy the API to StepZen.
```
âž” stepzen deploy
Deploying dev/spacex to StepZen... done in 5.3s ðŸš€

You can test your hosted API with curl:

curl https://chico.stepzen.net/dev/spacex/__graphql \
   --header "Authorization: Apikey $(stepzen whoami --apikey)" \
   --header "Content-Type: application/json" \
   --data-raw '{
     "query": "query SampleQuery { __schema { queryType { name description } } }"
   }'

Your API url is https://chico.stepzen.net/dev/spacex/__graphql

âž”
```
5. Using your preferred GraphQL client, test your API. Notice that mutations, history-related entry point fields, launch-related entry point fields, and the roadster entry point fields are not accessible.
6. Visit [jwt.io](https://jwt.io/#debugger-io) and create a JWT token for the API you just deployed, starting with the example payload below:
```
{
  "sub": "1234567890",
  "name": "John Doe",
  "iat": 1516239022,
  "allow_mutations": true,
  "roles": ["launch-viewer", "history-viewer"],
  "CUSTOM_CLAIM": {"level":42}
}
```
Enter `development-only` (the secret specified in the config.yaml) into the `secret` field to generate a JWT.

7. Test your API with the JWT you created. Notice that more fields are accessible than before.

8. Modify the claims in the JWT and try again with different tokens to see the different behavior.

9. Experiment with different rules in the config.yaml.
